# Data Visualization Final Project
---
Riley Rustad and Danish Iqbal

### Proposal
Every year the Portland Housing Bureau releases their annual “[State of Housing in Portland Report](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/phb/67393)” In their report they give updates to critical housing, demographic, and affordability metrics. We would like to create an interactive visualization that allows Portlandians to explore their city through the lense of this data, with the goal being that they better understand the current housing market city-wide, and not just where they live.

The report itself is well-written, graphically pleasing, and provides many interesting insights. That said, the 140 pages can be daunting for even us data nerds. Our goal is to create a tool that makes this report easily consumable for native portlandians, developers, and city legislators alike, and give them a view of the demographic view of neighborhood affordability in their city.

Here’s a sample page from the 2016 report:

#### Data sources:
- State of Housing in Portland Report
- ACS

#### Concept:

We would like to capture these table values, as well as other civic data, and allow the user to explore them visually on a map filtering by year, demographic, and housing size.

Provided there’s enough time, it would also be fun to explore additional data provided in the report, about increased developments, comparisons across the 2015 and 2016 reports. 

Last, it would be interesting to incorporate data from the American Community Survey(ACS). Luckily the shapefiles associated with the Report align with census blocks!
